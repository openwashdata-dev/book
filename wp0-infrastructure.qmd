# WP0: Infrastructure Design and Installation

:::{.callout-note}

## Goal: The Goal of WP0 is to prototype a technical foundation for the ORD toolchain at ETH in a a way that allows teaching and scientific collaboration to continue beyond the explore project's funding.

**RQ 0.1:** What are the costs and requirements for ORD tools to be hosted and maintained within the ETH domain?

**Activity 0.1:** Collaborate with ETH IT Services to establish Virtual Machines and RStudio Server (open source version) for 50 learners

**Activity 0.2:** Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of three open source tools for communication (Slack, Discord, Matrix Protocol)

**Activity 0.3:** Compare hosting costs and technical overhead (maintenance) of RStudio Cloud by RStudio PBC with Virtual Machines hosted at ETH Zurich.

During our upstream working package 0, we address costs and requirements for hosting a full fledged ORD process within the ETH domain. In the process, we will collaborate with ETH IT services to establish an open source backed ecosystem for a milestone of 50 learners. Infrastructure automation, e.g., through ansible automation platform is crucial to our approach: Scripted setups allow to reproduce our setup, disseminate our learnings and to foster ORD practices within ETH and beyond. Our work in WP0 is not limited to computing and version control infrastructure, we also plan to invest into communication tools that suit our approach of interactive collaboration in-person and online.

Based on our experience and previous work that lead to our submission, we intend to use open source software that is commonly applied throughout modern data science and statistics classes [@cetinkaya-rundel2018infrastructure], including: R and RStudio Server for programming; Quarto scientific and technical publishing system for authoring [@allaire2022quarto]; Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration; Matrix protocol for real-time communication ; Mailing list server for regular updates directly to email.

Together with ETH IT services we will not only evaluate the best options to self-host our current explore project, but also make sure our virtual infrastructure can be extended or migrated to other providers easily. The above ecosystem will be used for teaching, collaboration and community building beyond this project and contribute to the greater understanding of how open source software can be integrated into ETH infrastructure, teaching and learning. Given the heterogeneity of the WASH community, a non-propietary is crucial for global adaption of a technical framework.
